## History of Quantum Computing

## Qubits: What are they ?

<!-- TODO: Explain in more detail the concept -->

Quantum Computers differ from standard computers, in the sense that **they don't use conventional bits as treatment units**. Instead, they use an unit named **Qubit**. Qubits carry a **quantum state** as information, which means that
they are not simply 1 or 0, but they can be **|1⟩ or |0⟩**. This is a significant difference, since Qubits follow the
rules that have been seen in Lesson 1.

Visually, a Qubit can be represented with the **Bloch's Sphere**, named after the physicist [Felix Bloch][felix-bloch]:

As we can see, a Qubit requires three axes to be represented. The Z axis on the Bloch Sphere often corresponds to
the states **|1⟩ and |0⟩**, but the X and Y axes are just as important, since **it is possible to perform rotations around these axes, which could alter the information of the Qubit when observed.**
